# template-single-author

License/Copyright setup template for a single/fixed-author project (or where a
note about the revision history being the source of copyright information is
deemed unnecessary or placed into `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

1. Copyright notice(s) are in `LICENSE` if possible/desirable (e.g., MIT) or
   in `COPYRIGHT` otherwise (see `template-multi-author` for an example).

2. Copyright notices (whether in `LICENSE` or in `COPYRIGHT`) should be
   lingle lines in the form:

   ```
   Copyright (c) <years> <author>.
   ```

   This is important to prevent license mis-detection by GitHub, etc.
